    body: 'Most competitors space out their lights, leaving "dead zones" on your skin. Buudy features 192 High-Density LEDs, which is more than double the amount found in standard masks. This ensures every single inch of your skin receives consistent, effective treatment for faster results.',
  },
  {
    title: "Full Neck Coverage",
    kicker: 'Say No to "Turkey Neck"',
    body: "The face is only half the story. Unlike many popular brands that neglect the neck or charge extra for a separate attachment, Buudy includes integrated neck coverage. It is specifically designed to firm and rejuvenate the neck area, preventing aging where it often shows most.",

  {
    title: "8-in-1 Multi-Spectrum",
    kicker: "Therapy in a single device",

Whether you are fighting stubborn acne, reducing deep wrinkles, or supporting skin repair, you have a professional-grade solution for every skin concern.",

  },
  {
    title: "Ultimate Value",
    kicker: "A one-time investment",
